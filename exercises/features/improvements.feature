Feature: Improvements

  Let's see what impact using parameterized step definitions, Scenario Outlines and Backgrounds have on our step definitions

  Scenario: Mixing two colours works
    Given we start with an empty bucket of paint
    When we add red paint
    And we add yellow paint
    Then the result is orange paint

  Scenario: Mixing two different colours also works
    Given we start with an empty bucket of paint
    When we add blue paint
    And we add yellow paint
    Then the result is green paint

  Scenario: Mixing two other colours still works
    Given we start with an empty bucket of paint
    When we add red paint
    And we add blue paint
    Then the result is purple paint
