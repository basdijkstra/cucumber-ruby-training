Feature: Improvements

  Let's see what impact using parameterized step definitions, Scenario Outlines and Backgrounds have on our step definitions

  Scenario Outline: Mixing colors
    Given we start with an empty bucket of paint
    When we add <firstColour> paint
    And we add <secondColour> paint
    Then the result is <resultingColour> paint
    Examples:
      | firstColour | secondColour | resultingColour |
      | red         | yellow       | orange          |
      | blue        | yellow       | green           |
      | red         | blue         | purple          |
