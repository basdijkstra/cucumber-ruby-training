Feature: LoanApplication

  As a loan application evaluator
  I want to only approve loan requests that meet our agreed upon loan amount rules
  So the risk associated with supplying loans remains within regulatory boundaries

  Rule: Loan amount < $1,000 --> approved

    Scenario Outline: Loan amounts under 1000 are always approved
      Given John is an active ParaBank customer
      When they apply for a <amount> dollar loan
      Then the loan application is approved
      Examples:
        | amount |
        | 999    |
        | 1      |

  Rule: Loan amount >= $100,000 --> denied

  Scenario Outline: Loan amounts greater than or equal to 100000 are always denied
	Given John is an active ParaBank customer
	When they apply for a <amount> dollar loan
	Then the loan application is denied
	Examples:
	| amount |
	| 100000 |
	| 999999 |

  Rule: $1,000 <= loan amount < $100,000 --> approved when there is proof of monthly income >= $3,000, denied otherwise

  Scenario Outline: For loan amounts between 1000 and 100000 the result depends on income
    Given John is an active ParaBank customer
	And their monthly income is <income>
	When they apply for a <amount> dollar loan
	Then the loan application is <result>
	Examples:
	| amount | income | result   |
	| 1000   | 3000   | approved |
	| 50000  | 3000   | approved |
	| 99999  | 3000   | approved |
	| 1000   | 2999   | denied   |
	| 50000  | 2999   | denied   |
	| 99999  | 2999   | denied   |
